    "From the program I have designed, I believe that the answer to the problem is 50 percent. If every single possible combination of seating arrangements were to be simulated, 50 percent of them will feature the last person to enter the movie theatre actually sitting in their assigned seat. \n",
    "\n",
    "To prove this, I designed a program that simulates people entering the movie theatre one-at-a-time to sit down (following the rules of the scenario). Next, I created a function that runs the simulation a specified number of times and returns the number of times that the last person to enter the theatre sat in their assigned seat. Running it with n values up to 1000 several times, the average proportion of times returned by the function IterateExperiment was nearly a perfect half of all simulations. \n",
