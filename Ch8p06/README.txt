This program uses the class multiplyMatrix to take two inputted 3x3 matrices and output a 3x3 matrix composed of the two previous matrices multiplied together as follows:
To multiply matrix a by matrix b, the number of columns in a must be the same as the number of rows in b, and the two matrices must have elements of the same or compatible types. Let c be the result of the multiplication.
Assume the column size of matrix a is n.
For example, for two 3 * 3 matrices a and b, c, where cij =ai1 *b1j +ai2 *b2j +ai3 *b3j.
Test program that prompts the user to enter two 3 * 3 matrices and displays their product.
